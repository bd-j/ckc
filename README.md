===

Utilities for working with the CKC stellar spectral library, including tools for downsampling it (see ``make_libs.py``) and for converting it to h5py (``binary_to_hdf()``).

You should change the ``ckc_dir`` variable in ``ckc.py`` to reflect your local setup.  You should also place the binary spectral files in a ``bin/`` subdirectory of the main repo.
